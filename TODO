next few tasks:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  basically: keep up the good work, keep happy, become less destructive
             and depressive, get more coordination, get more focus, 
             calm down sometimes, do NOT skip the essiential breaks,
             divide work into smaller tasks, feeling the progress.

  - adapt XmlHttpRequest class from anyterm into unblu, finish implementing
    the unblu recorder api ontop of it.

  - get info about metadata extraction (there was some project at sf.net?)

 internet ideas:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - make an open online-repository with oo concepts? 
    would be good to encourage unified implementation/pattern style.
    would need a data format to communicate and store template/class info 
    (yaml, dot, c++ itself).
    also look at the possibility of mining patterns from source code, as 
    proposed by a paper i have seen.

  - make a http module for chaosircd which would allow one to write
    an ajax irc client (probably using parts of the anyterm code!)

  - make a web-based drum-machine, with a simple sequencer and probably
    some sound-design capabilities?
    sound will be generated from within an apache module, which streams
    it to an embedded flash object (invisible, the UI will be ajaxish)


 work ideas:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - make simple web-apps to navigate within a buildfarm and to build, collect 
    and manage packages.

  - mod_nexindex: make an ajax directory indexing module, with support 
    for annotation and meta-information (using libextract).

  - making a gecko render-engine run in realtime on a server with a custom 
    backend which allows for video-encoding. in it we could run the unblu
    player and thus providing means of exporting unblu sessions as video.


 opensource ideas:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - make a djb-styled library with memory management primitives, which can
    be used to build highly specialized memory allocators and some kind of
    container classes which can be built upon them.
    
  - make a GNU autoconf fork (dietconf) which utilizes shell functions 
    (say fn(){}) to achieve smaller configure scripts and faster runs.
    
  - collect stuff from all my makefiles previously written (chaosircd, shish,
    libborg) and put together a BSD-styled build system (consisting of a 
    library of .mk files, each dedicated to a simple task) which works together 
    with the previously mentioned autoconf fork.

  - make libchaos work ontop of libowfat! 
    it should provide at least a 'log', 'listen', 'connect' and a 'queue'
    class (the latter is a dynamically resizeable buffer).
    we will try to use the io_* functions from libowfat for non-blocking i/o.


 cvs reps to create:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  - libborg   (the super-duper template library)
  - liballoc  (find better name as there is already a liballoc)
  - chaosircd (and libchaos)
  - dietconf  (autoconf fork)
  - shish     (cvs2svn?)
  - compat    (libdl and dirent for mingw32)
  - tichu     (is on mia.nexbyte.ch as far as i remember)
  
  no longer maintaining the following?
  
  - zipios++  (hell, lets make the fork into a proper patch and submit it,
               i do not want to maintain this)
  - clipp     (would probably also be worth to make a patch to submit)
  - jsmm      (merge useable stuff into libborg, discard the rest)


 stuff to study:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - boost::serialization, 
    making it interoperable with borg::xml/yaml
  
  - libextract (metadata extraction)
    together with recls and yaml/sql it could seriously help to maintain messy 
    filesystems.
    there is also a vast amount of publications on IE (information extraction)
    and NLP (natural language processing) on the internet which can be
    consulted.

  - FreeLing,
    see if it could be used to extract information from documents 
    or to come up with a next-generation catty (the cybersex bot)
    
  - get cygwin rxvt sources and figure out how they made it running without
    being backed by an X11 server...
  
  - check which browsers already implement E4X (ECMAScript XML extension).

  - what would it require to implement YAML in JavaScript?

  - study SVG, Canvas and VML (and XHTML capabilities of current browsers).
    it would be possible to extend neximage with vector graphics capabilities.
    vector manipulation happens at the client side, the resulting vector data
    will be posted to an apache module which renders it using librsvg/cairo.

  - libfann,
    recent checkout, as they are working on it during googles SoC2007
  
  - VST, portmidi (and perhaps ALSA, JACK),
    to design an abstract midi interface within libborg.

 

 first sound libraries to adapt
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - Stk      (it has the facilities to implement
              those wonderful physical modeling
              techniques pioneered by music research
              god Julius Orion Smith)

  - SndObj   (general purpose synthesis lib)
  - Nsound   (not unlike SndObj, but much cleaner code)

 abstract interfaces to design
 ---------------------------------------------------

  damn, how to organize this properly? 
  a graph? 
  a README in every subdir?
  documentation like boost::iostreams?

  - memory: allocator, pool
 
            those are implemented by: apr... (and there are pools in boost)

  - fs:     file (iostream adapters?), dir (boost::filesystem::path adapter?)
  
            those are implemented by: apr, NSPR, wxWidgets

  - exec:   execution and process classes, allowing to supervise child processes
            and exchange data with them.

            this is implemented by: wxWidgets, GNU libiberty
            


 stuff to compile
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - CLAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  - proper nspr javascript dll! (actually have it installed, but make sure the
    packages are properly)

  - mysql for mingw32!
  - possibly postgresql for mingw32?

  - vstsdk and vstgui for both, unixes and windozes (for vstgui see anticore x11 port)

  - php static library, with and without tsrm
  - static mingw32 apache? (or lets just take the win32 binaries, possibly 
                            running them ontop self-built apr lib)

  - recompile xerces with original namespace (huh, does not compile any more?)
  - rebuild xerces with debugging symbols and without mingwm10.dll

  - another try at librsvg (or look for another svg lib)

  - fltk (wrap it along with wx in libborg)
  - qt?  (same thing here, but unlikely, because even huger than wx)
  - SDL?

  - mplayer? (at least get the manpage, which is lacking in the win32 pkg and thus missing on zwergli)
  - CSL?
  - some neural net libs
  - some genetic algo libs

  - the gccxml thing that interacts with reflex
  - cint and cintex

  - c++ to aterm format? codeboost!
  - c++ thing for stratego/aterm. codeboost!

  - nspr
  - js (using nspr and readline)
  - gccxml
  - OpenAL
  - CSL
  - CLAM
  - djbfft (weeeeeeoow!)
  - freeverb
  - IT++ (itpp)
  - libtsp
  - SndObj
  - juce!!!
  - pd
  - octave
  - libnoise
  - ODE
  - fftw (single and double precision)
  - ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net)

  - spuc
  - portmidi
  - upp
  - v
  - audicle
  - chuck
  - CSound
  - DISSCO
  - openmusic
  
 less important builds:
 ----------------------

  - loris
  - libDSP
  - mustajuuri
  - spkit


 projects to check:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - http://camfr.sourceforge.net/
  - http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/
  - http://cern.ch/gaudi
  - svn up libindustry
  - watch latest boost developments
  - http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/
  - inform about that stratego thing
  - watch frequently at www.anticore.org


 maintaining tasks:
 ---------------------------------------------------

   - add GNUmakefile to libxml2
   - add GNUmakefile to
   - compile libtdl for amygdala
   - compile vanilla SndObj
   - compile portmidi


 library functionality to establish:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - obsolete libchaos servauth (by implementing a slots-based thing which queues
    dns/auth requests)
  - separate libowfat hacks within shish and make shish work with plain lowfat
  - XML I/O (Currently there is DOM implemented on xerces-c, and DOM/XPath implemented on libxml2,
             and there is partial support for DOM using the XML parser of wxWidgets XML)
  - yaml i/o
  - adapt iostreams (indentation filter etc.)
  - A generic vector drawing context which abstracts between cairo, SVG and OpenGL.
    
  - Make a working JavaScript parser.
    For JS it gets more and more clear that SpiderMonkey is preferred over the parser from the
    clipp project (by Peder Holdt), which is designed to evaluate just as it parses.
    Using SpiderMonkey is also supported by the fact that also other parts of this well-developed
    and widely-deployed engine are being adapted to generic concepts.
    It will however be a bit of a dirty work as the extraction of the syntax 
    tree needs to be done intrusively, say with knowledge of SpiderMonkeys
    private data structures.

  - Make a C++ parser.
    There is nothing OpenSource which is more complete than g++. There have been alot attempts at this
    by numerous people. There are also cint (used by CERN-ROOT), OpenC++ and gccxml to mention other
    C++ parsing tools. Of these only the latter, being based upon a patched g++, covers the full C++98 
    standard. But it is limited in its intention of providing interface information, written to an XML.
    Also, this interface information (classes, method- and function-prototypes etc.) is not at syntax-
    tree level but at RTL (runtime-language) level which provides already binary infos like the byte-size
    of every type. It covers template instantiations but not the template itself as they already have
    been thrown away by gcc at this time.

  - Author name, title, abstract and references extraction, 
    to handle the growth of my private PDF collection.

  - PE/COFF/ELF reader class (ldd, symbol rewriting)
  - gccxml -> build ast using xpath (using the libxml2 instantiation of the generic xml templates)
  - grammar for makefiles?
  - unify generic string from xml/lib/string.hpp with util/string stuff.. make a std::traits class... adapt all strings
  - accumulate JSContext into thread-local-storage?
    the current implementation of the js::context, the other js:: classes
    and the generic classes which should abstract them struggles with the
    extra argument for passing the context each time. also it has been implemented
    to revert to a default context (and creating it when necessary) when this
    extra-argument is not specified. this however increases the risk to break
    thread-safety by forgetting the extra argument (because the default is taken
    silently then).
    


 tools to write:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - g++ driver/wrapper: catches error messages (especially those widely feared ones
    that unroll template instantiations) and reformats them for improved readability.
    otherwise it should have the same functionality as the original driver in that
    it coordinates the compilation of one or more compilation units, doing the necessary
    preprocessor, compiler, assembler and linker runs.
  
  - write cgrep, a code-aware grep which knows different languages and can 
    tokenize and perhaps partly parse them.
    in contrast to grep it will match language tokens or function prototypes
    rather than lines. also, it will not output a line per match, rather it 
    will output the containing block of code or the function prototype.
    the output can be syntax-highlited (already working with c++).
    
    on the 2007-06-30 i found that there is already a 'cgrep', althought not
    specialised on code it has the very similar goal of a 'Context grep', not 
    limited to matching lines but rather trying to be context-aware.    
    the paper 'Context grep' by Charles L.A. Clarke and Gordon V. Cormack dated
    november 30, 1996 (!!!) covers it.

  - write a program-transformation shell. it will have advanced code browsing 
    and replacing capabilities and some basic refactoring functions.

  - utility to create an archetype from a class/interface... 
    ...and subsequently to create a concept check from the archetype..

    for definitions, look at the documentation of boost::concept_check

    furthermore i am after cross-language oo modeling, it should be possible
    to seamlessly port abstract concepts between languages, thus making algorithms
    and data structures designed for one language (automatically) portable to all
    other supported languages. the specialities and limitations of each supported
    language must be taken into account and guidelines/patterns for modelling have 
    to be carefully developed.
    

 bugs to fix:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - make defined() work in list_includes.cpp
  - get the clipp javascript parser to output an AST, 
    rather than launching its actors.


 quick notes:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  -  damian.senn@gmail.com

 gui coding tasks:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - make cairo working ontop a vstgui::dc or wx::dc
  - define generic interfaces for audio/midi i/o
  - implement generic gui controls:
      - knob
      - adjust
      - fader
      - togglebutton
  - implement the bank/program/parameter complex
  - make the vst host work
  - make threading work

 INTERESTS
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - Programming

    - language independence, on source level rather than
      binary level (pfui java & cli, love meta- and generative programming)
     
      Hell, wait, some kind of "runtime adapting" to link shared libs into 
      different languages could be cool. (20070626 - isnt this what libffi and the like do?)

    - Debugging, Profiling 
   
    - Reverse engineering
   
    - Source code indexing/mining
   
    - Intelligent, automated builds

 concepts:
 ---------------------------------------------------

  - GUI Widgets
  
     - Analytical: e.g. Histograms, Clouds (Well, need to look at CERNs ROOT)

  - Sound Designer
  
    The sound designer is a special form of a wave-
    editor. It consists of a visual editing area
    which is displaying actual Waveforms and
    Envelopes. Waveforms and Envelopes span over
    the whole duration of the edited sound and can
    be visually layered.

    The other part is a modular (but not necessarily
    realtime) synthesis engine, similar to Max, 
    PureData and their derivates.
    
    The envelopes from the editing area can be 
    mapped freely to multiple inputs of the synthesis
    engine modules.
    Outputs of the synthesis engine modules can be
    routed to waveform displays in the editing area
    for visual feedback.

    Focus is on providing transparent and meaningful
    ways of designing the timbral properties and the
    progression of sounds.
    
    Additionaly it may help to extract a useable
    parameter range for modulation of the designed
    sound during performance. Certain parameters
    at different stages of synthesis may be partially
    or fully freezed, leaving only intended parameters.
    For this to work a special sound storage format
    has to be found.
    

  - Sound Performer
  
    Arrangement, Sequencing and Modulation engine.
   
    Neural nets?
    Morphing?

  - Sound Control
  
    - Sound Modulation
    
      Abstract low-level synthesis parameters into
      more meaningful parameter sets (Properties
      of resonant materials, Enviromental properties,
      etc.)
    
    - Sound Physics/Dynamics
    
      Add physical/dynamical simulations, which is currently
      missing in "state-of-the-art" virtual analog synths, which
      is why real analog synths are still preferred by many
      producers.
      Could be implemented using ODE (Open Dynamics Engine).
    
    - Sound Guidance
    
      Sequence/Modulate for example the Beat-Machine
      while the Performer is playing a Melody.
    
  - Cross-Instance within plugin hosts?  

    A plugin which provides signal paths between
    multiple Tracks and Sends in Ableton Live.
    The plugin is instantiated multiple times in
    different tracks and sends and shows up the
    connection possibilities in a common GUI.
